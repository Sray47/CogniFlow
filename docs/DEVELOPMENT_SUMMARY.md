## üöÄ Ready for Phase 2: AI Integration

The architecture is designed for easy AI service integration:

### Planned AI Services

**Conversational AI Service**
```python
# Future: services/ai-service/main.py
@app.post("/ai/chat")
async def chat_with_tutor(message: str, user_id: int):
    # OpenAI/Hugging Face integration
    response = await generate_ai_response(message, user_context)
    return {"response": response}
```

**Analytics Service**
```python
# Future: services/analytics-service/main.py
@app.get("/analytics/learning-patterns/{user_id}")
async def analyze_learning_patterns(user_id: int):
    # ML-powered learning analytics
    return learning_insights
```

### Easy Integration Points

1. **Add to docker-compose.yml**
2. **Route in API Gateway**
3. **Connect from Frontend**
4. **Scale independently**
